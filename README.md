# colade
Colade is a blog/static site generator written in go, I designed this to learn more about the go language, it is not meant to be a full featured static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll.

Features:
- Fast(like really fast)
- No lock in, uses standard markdown files, you can use any markdown editor you like and generate a website with colade.
- Simple and easy to use CLI
- Aims to keep page size small(<14kb compressed) based on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44613625
